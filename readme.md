# JavaScript DC 3 Scavenger Hunt
The purpose of this exercise is to get you familiar with navigating the file system on your computer through the command line and with using git. To that effect, fork this repository and clone it locally. Explore the wild jungle of folders collecting as many rubies as you can and move them in to your `stash`. When you are finished, commit your changes, showing all the rubies you collected in your `stash` and create a pull request.
